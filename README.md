This initial version employs a brute-force approach to explore all possible paths between the start and end vertices, ultimately identifying the path with the minimum distance. 

**To use the JericallaPerrito Graph Shortest Path Finder, follow these steps:**

+ Initialize the graph with the desired number of vertices
+ Initialize the inicio and fin variables to determine the two nodes you will make a path for
+ Call the FuerzaBruta function with the start and end vertices to find the shortest path

**Future work:**
+ Complete the problem solution
+ Add graphic interface
+ Maybe add divide and conquer or dynamic programming besides brute force strategy
+ Add time complexity graph
+ Compare the strategies
+ Solve with heuristic algorithm
+ Finish scientific paper
